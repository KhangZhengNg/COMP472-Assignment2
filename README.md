## Instructions on how to run the code

In order to run the code, the following python packages need to be installed:
* numpy
* warnings

In order to install packages, pip is the preferred installer: https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/

Additionally, since all the above files are .ipynb files, jupyter notebook as well as miniconda need to installed. </br>

For Jupyter: https://jupyter.org/install

To open the jupyter notebook, from the command line, go to the folder in which your .ipynb files are located and enter `jupyter notebook`. Then, once the file is open, to run the code on the notebook, go to the "Cell" Tab and press "Run All".
